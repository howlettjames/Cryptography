Children:

Elohim! - I shall not forgive!
Adonai! - I shall not forgive!
Living God! - I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ! - I forgive thee not!



Enthrone thyself, O Archuman
O how thou shineth in the realm above
As planets rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk this Earth like a shimmering god

Let it be forever heard
We lost our Eden to own the world
Let it be forever known
We lost our battle to win the war

Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!

Let it be forever heard
From Slave to king, from king to man
Let it be eternally known
We fled from heavens to rape the world



There's a serpent coiling around my neck
The adoring crescent moon in blazing night
The holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair
In the ancient times before I learned ov who I am

If I am a missing link between the pig and the divine
I shall cast the pearls before the swine

I am no good shepherd on an ox
But a solitude ov the loneliest star
Like a thousand shrines subsumed into the void
Like a dead space in between the suns

Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us

Elohim ([children:] Elohim!)
I shall not forgive!
Adonai ([children:] Adonai!)
I shall not forgive!
Living God ([children:] Living God!)
I shall not forgive!
Jesus Christ ([children:] Jesus Christ!)
I forgive thee not!



Eritis Sicut Dii
Thus sermonized the serpent ov eden
Thus struck the breath ov the earth
And thus flooded the blood ov the soil
Slither into the gaping void!

I worship thee, O vicious man!
Now mark my words ye mortal race
Feed my wrath with lion's gore
Feed my envy with the fat ov lambs
As the wicked ways will flourish
Behold the monuments ov god decay

Lex Divinus, I stamp the dust
I despoil the holy books
I desecrate the angelic verses
Like dead leaves wither they to ash
As I am leading the hosts ov stars
Onwards, embrace the sun

In absentia dei
We sermonize
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!

I have watched the birth ov planets
I have witnessed the death ov worlds
I've conducted the choir ov stars
I have ridden the tail ov the comet
(As I've transformed)
From god to ash
From dust to man

In absentia dei we evangelize
In absentia christi we spread like swarming plagues
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!



Crawl with insects and feed on barren soil!
Or rise above the animal in you!
Find kindness among the unkind!
Slowness ov decrepitude
Like sirens beckoning me to their ruined shores!
Impotent in the eye ov the storm!
Cthonic ore forefathers!
Ravishing sires ov the black hosts!

Feast on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Prometheus' Rebirth!

Ere constellations were dust!
And thus thou empowered me!
I am legion in company ov seraphs!
At the threshold ov this godless anarchy!
Malediction to all that is Angelic!
Pariah ov collapsing truth!
Crucifixion was not enough!
The alpha ov this mortal whorl!

Feed on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Bael!
Orobas!
Astaroth!
Asmoday's Rebirth!



Begone!
Ye prophets ov Eucharist
My praise shall climb to your decline
May rust corrode on Michael's sword
Recession ov the progeny divine
Come forth ye!
Preachers ov imminent death
Let loose the mighty beasts upon
(Damnatio ad Bestiam!)
Bring an end to this decrepit world

Countless my legions
Many my name
A thousand descendants
A goat ov mendes

Come forth ye!
Heralds ov ruin
And mute to dust their anaemic ways
Futile Relic ov an utopian age
King ov kings recrucified
What an ignominous end!
El shadda!
Woe unto thee
O Galilean god
Be thou ashamed
Yhwh!
Woe unto thee
To aeons i curse!

Countless my legions
Many my name
A thousand young
A goat ov mendes

For i am my christ over myself
The accused became the accuser
For i am Satan incarnate
Serpent ov old immaculate!



I am she who spits out the lusts
The root ov sin derived from me
I am born ov sacrilegious uterus
Magna peccatrix
I am she who cast the enemies out
I am the spawn ov her vulva obsolete
Libera nos blasfemia madonna
Magna hecate

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be exalted!
Come to be despised!

For i am Aurora's son
With no beginning, with no decline
Sabbath mater dolorosa
A progeny ov her lecherous cunt
Love me orgasmically
Fuck me ecstatically
Genetrix meretix
I pledge my heart to thee
I bow down devotedly

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be honoured
And to be despised!

Blessed be the destroyer
For she's the creator!



Our father, who art in hell
Unhallowed be thy name
Thy legions come
Thy enemies begone
On earth as it is in the netherworld
Embrace our souls untraveled
Let us sail to the farthest sea
Ignite our craving hearts
Illuminate our ageless will

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

Our father, who lies in wait
Unhallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom enshrines
Thy phosphor blinds
On earth as it is in hell
Embrace my soul untraveled
Let me sail to the farthest sea
When i am thou, O lord
And lord when thou art me

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

By thou holy name Satan
And his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name Lucifer
At his command
Heaven shall blaze!

By thou holy name Leviathan
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name Belial
At his command
Heaven shall burn!



Morning star
Phosphoros
How thou shinest in the fiery empyrean above
Paracletus
How do I rejoice, for thy apostles flock around
For thou art christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up thy cells
Below sheol, where odium dwells

Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Hades set ajar

Let the cold moon lick the blood from my stigmatas
Let the burning sun devour gore from my wounds
For I am Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up my cells
Deep down below my odium dwells

Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Pandemonium set ajar

I am he who lives, and was dead
And behold, I am alive forevermore
I am he who lives, and was dead
And behold, I am alive forevermore



Oh sun and moon beheld!
When we rose up from dust
No sound or song would dare dispraise
The might we have become

We hail to thee, O avenging force!
We are the dawn ov new Jerusalem
We are the ending ov all days
We are the next 1000 years

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
To the emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
To the devil in our souls!

We go where no mortals dare to go
Explore the human flesh yet not explored
The tree ov god shall not withstand the ruthless storm
We are the death that rides the pale horse

We hail to thee, O avenging force!
We are the deportees from the Promised Land
Fallen, but we re-write history with blood
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, fallss saviour on the cross
To the emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
To the devil in our souls!



Can you withstand the rapid currents ov the river Rubicon?
Can you feel the pulse ov ecclesial litanies?
Can you bring the enemy who can match my wrath?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Earth?

Can you feel the heartbeat down in the belly ov the Leviathan?
Can you see the loving God in the dying flesh ov his most beloved son?
Can you taste the gangrenous fruit from the forbidden tree?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Sea?

Rex Infernus!
Antichrist!
Born ov the shadows!
Warring Mars!

Can you smell the genesis ov victory when the sacrum's raped?
Can you hear Chaldean prayers chanting ov my name?
Can you curse all those who say: conquered is life?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Air!

Can you taste the blood ov Abel on the sacrificial knife?
Can you convey the souls out from the bosom ov Abraham?
Can you confront the speculum ov thy soul with the fearless eye?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Fire!

Rex Infernus!
Antichrist!
Born ov the shadows!
Wrath ov Mars!

Find divity in harlot’s lechery
Seek monogamy in lustful flames
I, once married to the Peccatrix Divine
I find redemption in the Faustian light

"Arise, O Man, in thy strength! the kingdom is thine to
Inherit
Till the high gods witness at lenght that Man is the Lord
Of his spirit. "



I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve, dissolved by flame
Looked down on Son ov God, snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread, and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return (Hail! Hail! Hail!)

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna! (hosanna)
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna! (hosanna)
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our hearts
