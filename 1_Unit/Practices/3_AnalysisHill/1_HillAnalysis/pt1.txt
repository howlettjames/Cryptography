Children:

Elohim! - I shall not forgive!
Adonai! - I shall not forgive!
Living God! - I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ! - I forgive thee not!

Enthronef thyself, O Archuman
O how thou shineth in the realm above
As planetsc rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk thisk Earth like a shimmering god

Lets it be forever heard
We losta our Eden to own the world
Let itn be forever known
We lost ourd battle to win the wara

Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!
